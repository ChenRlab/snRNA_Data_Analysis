This repository contains the analysis pipeline for single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data generated from mouse heart tissue. 
The scripts provided here were used to process, analyze, and interpret the snRNA-seq data presented in the associated manuscript.

# The raw sequencing data are not publicly available but will be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request after publication.
